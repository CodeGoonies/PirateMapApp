# Contribute
Anyone can contribute to this repo! Just fork the repo, make your addition on a seperate 
branch off of development (If you forget no biggie, it's dev at least). We do like well 
named branches for features and commit messages to be auction based. Branches can just be 
named after the new feature (or bug lol) they are introducing. A safe strategy for commit 
messages is to just put what the commit does. For example, "This commit will... [fix 
FUBAR code/update key ABC/defeat dragons]"

After you've completed your contribution, simply make a pull request (PR) that can go back
into the development branch! Once the development branch is so far along, we'll merge it
into master, tag it up, and make a new release!

Happy coding and thanks for your contribution!
